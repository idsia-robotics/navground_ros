Introduction
============

`Navground <https://idsia-robotics.github.io/navground/>`_, short **Nav**\ igation Play\ **ground**\ , is a playground to experiment with navigation algorithms.

This package provides a `ROS2 <https://docs.ros.org>`_ node to perform 2.5D obstacle avoidance, wrapping the navground core C++ library with a ROS2 compliant interface.

With this package, you make ROS2 robots navigate and avoid obstacles using any navigation behavior and kinematics implemented in navground.
